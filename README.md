# Idle Avoider
This little program prevents computer from going to sleep and change its status to idle, while also preventing apps such as IMs from changing to status idle or away.

## Tasks
Program performs different tasks to avoid idle status, and you must select at least 1 before pressing start.
  - *Move Mouse* - Mouse cursor will get random directions
  - *Use Notepad* - A new notepad will be opened and random characters will be typed
  - *Use Calculator* - A new calc will be opened and random numbers will be typed
  - *F15 keypress* (**default**) - F15* key will be pressed once

_*F15 is not a real key, but it is an option to pass as a key being pressed. That's why it's the most unintrusive option._

## Run cycle
This is the time that will wait in between tasks measured in seconds. You can set this option to whatever you want, but it will be validate that it's a number. _By default, it will be set in 30 seconds._


# Donations
It's a pretty simple program, but it does its job fairly well. I think it's not complicated for anyone to do it, and it can be educational to look at the code; I know it was for me. If you think it's worth something, I gladly accept [donations via Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=aresiusxp%40gmail%2ecom&lc=AR&item_name=Idle%20Avoider%20Donation&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted").
